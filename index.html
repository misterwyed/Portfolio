            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am Mayank Singh, a Software Developer with expertise in Java, Spring Boot, Python, and automation. Currently, I work at STL Digital, where I integrate network elements and develop automation solutions for Nokia. I have hands-on experience in backend development, building and optimizing applications using Java and Spring Boot, along with writing Python scripts to automate network tasks and processes.</br>

                I’ve worked on projects like USD Segmentation and NSIGHT, where I integrated network elements, installed Fast Passes, and automated bulk operations through scripting. I hold a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Galgotias College of Engineering and Technology, graduating with a CGPA of 7.8.</br>
                
                Additionally, I am certified in both RHCSA (Linux) and CKA (Kubernetes), which reinforces my technical proficiency in backend and system administration.

            <h4>Project Name — Live Object Detection in Real Time</h4>
            Efficient and accurate object detection has been an important topic in the
            advancement of computer vision systems. The project aims to incorporate
            state-of-the-art technique for object detection with the goal of achieving
            high accuracy with a real-time performance. A major challenge in many
            of the object detection systems is the dependency on other computer
            vision techniques for helping the deep learning based approach, which
            leads to slow and non-optimal performance. In this project, we use a
            completely deep learning based approach to solve the problem of object
            detection in an end-to-end fashion.

        <article><h4>Project Name — Dairy Management System</h4>
            Dairy Management System is an application or software designed to
            manage activities related to your daily work such as milk collections from
            cows, sales of the milk and all the dairy-related processes. It became
            tough for dairy owners to manage all dairy work manually. To reduce
            manual work, A dairy management.
