            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am Mayank Singh, a Software Developer with expertise in Java, Spring Boot, Python, and automation. Currently, I work at STL Digital, where I integrate network elements and develop automation solutions for Nokia. I have hands-on experience in backend development, building and optimizing applications using Java and Spring Boot, along with writing Python scripts to automate network tasks and processes.</br>

                I’ve worked on projects like USD Segmentation and NSIGHT, where I integrated network elements, installed Fast Passes, and automated bulk operations through scripting. I hold a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Galgotias College of Engineering and Technology, graduating with a CGPA of 7.8.</br>
                
                Additionally, I am certified in both RHCSA (Linux) and CKA (Kubernetes), which reinforces my technical proficiency in backend and system administration.

                <h4>Project Name — Live Object Detection in Real Time</h4>
                Efficient and accurate object detection has been an important topic in the advancement of computer vision systems. 
                The project aims to incorporate state-of-the-art technique for object detection with the goal of achieving high 
                accuracy with a real-time performance. A major challenge in many of the object detection systems is the dependency 
                on other computer vision techniques for helping the deep learning based approach, which leads to slow and 
                non-optimal performance. In this project, we use a completely deep learning based approach to solve the problem 
                of object detection in an end-to-end fashion.
